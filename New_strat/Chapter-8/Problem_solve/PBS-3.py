# # how to prevent to print a new line in python

# # simply you can use end=""
print(" 10 ")  # in hear we didn't use end=""
print(" 20 ")  # so line 10 and 20 print in different line
print(" 30 ", end="")  # but how ever here we use end=""
print(" 40 ", end="")  # so line 30 and 40 print in same line
