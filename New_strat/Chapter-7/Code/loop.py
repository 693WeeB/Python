# printing  number 0 to 69 using loop

# for i in range(1, 7):
#     print(i)

# ok how this work ?
# first we give i a value of 1 and then we give a reange to i 
# wich is 1 to 69 and then the loop start from 1 to 69
# every time the loop run it do +1  like 
# first the loop start with 1 and print 1 then it do +1 then
# it become 2 and print 2 then it do +1 then it become 3
# everytime it +1 with i and print the value
# when he get to the range we give to it it will stop the loop and exit out from the loop
# this is the main fundamental of the loop 
#  and it work same with For loop and while loop
# like we can do 


#  for loop
# i = 1  # hear we give i a value of 1
# for i in range(10):  #  hear we give this for loop a range of 10 it means it will execut the program and when it get to 10 it will stop the loop and exit for the next
#     print(i)  # and hear we just print the loop value


# now While loop
# i = 1  # hear we did the same we give i a value of 1
# while i < 10: # hear we give a condition to the loop that is if i is less then 10 then it will execut the program and when it get to 10 it will stop the while loop and will exit for the next 
#     print(i) # and hear we just print the loop value
#     i = i + 1  # and hear we did the same we give i a value of 1 and every time the loop run it will do +1 with i value untile it rich to 10
