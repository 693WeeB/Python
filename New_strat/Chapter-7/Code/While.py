# ok lets try while loops

i = 1 

while (i < 10):
    print(i)
    #  i + 1 # if we do this it will start a infinite loop
    i += 1   #  so we should do this

# '''
# # #output
# # # 1 it start with 1 and then do +1 then it become 2
# # # 2 and the it add +1 then it become 3
# # # 3 and then it add +1 then it become 4
# # # 4 and then it add +1 then it become 5
# # # 5 and then it add +1 then it become 6
# # # 6 and then it add +1 then it become 7
# # # 7 and then it add +1 then it become 8
# # # 8 and then it add +1 then it become 9
# # # 9 and then it will do +1 then it become 10
# # # and when it become 10 it will chack the condition that is 
# # if i < 10 i is less then 10 then it is true so it work the program
# # when it come to 9 and do +1 and become 10 then it chak is 10 is less then 10 then 
# # it is false so it will stop the loop and exit the loop
