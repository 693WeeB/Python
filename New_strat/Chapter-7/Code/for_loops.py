# all the methods of for loops

# hear we write a basic form of for loop

# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)


# hear we gonna try the brack stetment in the for loop

# for i in range(20): # hear we give a range of 20
#     print(i)
#     if i == 8: # hear we give a condition if i == 8 then brack out the loop dont exicute the loop any more
#         break  # hear we inter inside the if statment inside the for loop and we use the brack stetment to break the loop


# and now we aew gonna try the continu funtion in for loop

for i in range(10):  # hear we give i to a range of 10
    print(i)  # and we just run and print the basic for loop
    if i == 6:  # and hear we give a conditon that is if i is == 6 then dont matter what happand run the loop to its end or range
        continue  # and this is the continue funtion so now we give condition i == 6 to continue
# so thats why it wont print the value of 6 and it will contineue to the end

#  pass
# and now we are gonna see a funtion calld pass in loops 
# it work on every loop but it work same as break
# it litrally mean just pass the loop for the next part

for i in range(10):  # hear we write a basic for loop
    pass  # thats it we just pass the loop and it wont give us any error
