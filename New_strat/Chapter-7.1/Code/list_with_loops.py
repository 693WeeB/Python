# now write a program that print the items of the list using loops

# lets try with for loops

# list = ["Egg", "Milk", "Bread", "Banana"]
# print(type(list))

# for i in list:
#     print(i)

# now write the same program using while loop

List = [
    "Beef",
    "Lamb",
    "Chicken",
    "Camel"
]
print("The type is", type(List))
i = 0
while (i < len(List)):
    print(List[i])
    i = i + 1
