# # in this code we have to print 0-40 number using for loop with step 4

# for i in range(0, 40, 4):  # (0 = start, 40 = end, 4 = step size)
#     print(i)


# ok try again

# for i in range(0, 25, 5):
#     print(i)


# ok now try this step slice using while loop

# i = 0
# while (i < 25):
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 5

# lets try again

i = 0
while (i < 25):
    print(i)
#    i = i + 1  # in hear if we do i = i + 1 then it work normal everyday wile lop 
    # so if we want to do step sliceing then we have to da i = i + 5 or 4  what step number we want
    i = i + 5
