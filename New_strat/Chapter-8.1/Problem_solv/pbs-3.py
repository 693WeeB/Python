# # hear we are gonna see the use case of end="" functions

print("hello A")  # # hear we didnt use end="" on A and B
print("hello B")  # # so we get a new line after B
print("hello C", end=" ")  # # hear we used end="" on C and D
print("hello D", end=" ")  # # so thats why we didnt get any new line and print Cand D in the same line
